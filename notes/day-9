spring cloud circuit breaker:
	. microservices most of the time are orchestrated
	. 
	
today's topics :
	1. circuit breaker introduction
	2. gateway load balancing ( we need three services 1. eurekalb, 2. servicelb, 3. gatewaylb)
	3. sleuth
	
	
cloud:gateway:discovery:locator:enables:true -to enable auto load balancing
eureka:client:service-url:default-zone: http://localhost:8761/eureka



-------------------------------------------------

first class project :
	. spring web
	. resilience4g 
	. actuators 
	. devtools
	
add @CircuitBreaker(name="client-cb", fallbackMethod= "generateResponse") annotations in the project

public String generateResponse(Throwable throwable){
	return "The server is unavailable temporarily"

-------------------------------------------------

add this piece of code in any code : (good piece of info. )
	. String port = environment.getProperty("server.port");
	. return "Programming Microservice @ " + port;
	. 

-------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
ignore sleuth , not supported in latest versions
hence we have to learn 'prometheus'.


after lunch :
	
SLEUTH : Spring Sleuth is a tool that helps track what’s happening in a computer program, especially when it's doing many things at once.
		 In short, Spring Sleuth helps you understand and trace the different steps of a program to find and fix issues more easily.
	
sleuth : application -> request -> thread -> needle haystack

 [application name, traceId, spanID, export]
 
Application name – This is the name we set in the properties file, and can be used to aggregate logs from multiple instances of the same application.

TraceId – This is an id that’s assigned to a single request, job, or action. 
		Something like each unique user initiated web request will have its own traceId.
		
SpanId – Tracks a unit of work. Think of a request that consists of multiple steps.
		Each step could have its own spanId and be tracked individually. 
		By default, any application flow will start with the same TraceId and SpanId.
		
Export – This property is a boolean that indicates whether or not this log was exported to an aggregator like Zipkin. 
		Zipkin is beyond the scope of this article, but plays an important role in analyzing logs created by Sleuth.
		
ZIPKIN : It is a tool that supports SLEUTH.

Security & Application Security :
	. 
	. 
	. 

- Learn how to write filters (security - servlet filters)

- spring security filter chain

- OAuth

- Single sign-on 

we will start with 'Basic Authentication' :
	. usernames and passwords are stored in memory
	. LDAP (light-weight directory access protocol)
	. 

@EnableMethodSecurity
